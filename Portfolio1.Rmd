# 1:Introduction
In the recent past, minorities in Tacoma, Washington were denied access to home loans based on where they lived. This practice is known as redlining because property assessors would create maps with minority communities outlined in red. The red outline told bankers those minority communities were not fit for loans. The consequence of redlining was a significant disparity in mortgage loans and homeownership rates between white communities and minority communities.

Today, banks donâ€™t practice redlining, but disparities in mortgage loans and homeownership still exist at a significant rate. For example, the average homeownership rate in the West Census Region is 59.3 %; however, the average homeownership rate for minorities (47.9 %) is 11.4 points below the West Census Region's average, and 25.2 points below their white peers (73.1 %).

Homeownership is an effective wealth generating tool. According to a study conducted by the Demos organization, if disparites in homeownership rates were closed; the wealth gap between white and black families decreased by 31 %. Because of these circumstances, an analysis of home mortgage data to discover patterns in loan approval / denial rates in the Tacoma-Lakewwood area is warranted.


## 1.1: Data
Analysis began by gathering data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB provides access to loan-level data so that trends in mortgage applications can be monitored. Action taken on loan applications, HUD median income, loan amount, appliancts income, race and ethnicity, gender, loan type and purpose are some of the variables that are included in the dataset from the CFPB. For this analyses, the mortgage dataset included 35,000 observations for the Tacoma-Lakewood area, of which 85 % of the applicants were approved for mortgages. 

## 1.2: Methods
To guide the modeling approach, the process began with the assumption that minorities were denied mortgage loans at a greater rate than non-minorites when controlling for loan amount,income and other factors. This hypothesis was based on trends in homeownership rates. Furthermore, logistic regression was used to generate the probability of the rejection of a mortgage loan based on race.

# 2: Exploratory Analysis
Exploratory analysis was used to understand how categorical variables were related and the associations between continuous, independent variables.
